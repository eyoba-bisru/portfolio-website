        Hello, I'm Eyob Abebe, a passionate Full-stack Developer based in Addis
        Ababa, Ethiopia. I specialize in both front-end and back-end
        development, using technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
        Express.js, and Go to build dynamic and efficient web applications.
        Currently, I am an Application Developer at Amhara Bank, where I have
        had the opportunity to contribute to the development, maintenance, and
        optimization of banking systems. My experience has provided me with a
        solid understanding of the complexities involved in building and
        managing large-scale applications. I hold a Bachelor's degree in
        Software Engineering from Bahir Dar University, where I graduated with a
        GPA of 3.93. I am a fast learner, detail-oriented, and thrive in
        team-oriented environments where collaboration is key. Iâ€™m passionate
        about continuously improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the
        latest industry trends and technologies. I am eager to apply my
        knowledge and passion for development to make a meaningful impact in the
        tech world.
        <br />
        <br />
        Feel free to connect with me or reach out for any opportunities or
        collaborations!
